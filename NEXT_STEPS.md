2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "New Project" ‚Üí "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your backend folder
5. Add environment variables:
   - `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`: (generate with Python)
   - `DEBUG`: False
   - `ALLOWED_HOSTS`: your-app.railway.app
6. Deploy and copy your URL

#### Frontend ‚Üí Vercel (20 minutes)
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "New Project"
4. Import your frontend folder
5. Add environment variable:
   - `REACT_APP_API_URL`: https://your-backend.railway.app/api

Subject: Full Stack Developer Assessment - ELD Trip Planner

Hi [Hiring Manager],

I've completed the Full Stack Developer assessment. Here are the deliverables:

üåê Live Application: [Your Vercel URL]
üé• Loom Video: [Your Loom Link]
üìö GitHub Repository: [Your Repo Link]

The application features:
- Django REST API backend
- React frontend with modern UI
- Route calculation with OpenStreetMap
- HOS compliance calculations
- ELD log generation
- Fully responsive design

Tech Stack:
- Backend: Django 4.2, DRF, Python 3.11
- Frontend: React 18, TailwindCSS, Leaflet
- Deployment: Railway (backend), Vercel (frontend)

Feel free to test with any US addresses. The app handles short to long-distance trips with automatic rest break scheduling and ELD log generation.

Let me know if you have any questions!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Failed to calculate trip"
- **Cause**: Backend not running or wrong URL
- **Fix**: Check REACT_APP_API_URL in Vercel settings

### Map not showing
- **Cause**: Internet connection or Leaflet CSS
- **Fix**: Check browser console, verify Leaflet CSS loaded

### CORS errors
- **Cause**: Backend CORS not configured
- **Fix**: Verify CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS in settings.py

### 500 Internal Server Error
- **Cause**: Backend error
- **Fix**: Check Railway logs, verify environment variables

### Geocoding fails
- **Cause**: Rate limiting or invalid address
- **Fix**: Wait a few seconds, try more specific address

## Tips for Success

### Before Submitting
- ‚úÖ Test on multiple browsers
- ‚úÖ Test on mobile device
- ‚úÖ Verify all features work
- ‚úÖ Check for console errors
- ‚úÖ Test with different trip lengths
- ‚úÖ Verify logs download correctly

### During Demo/Interview
- Be ready to explain technical decisions
- Know your code structure
- Understand HOS regulations
- Explain API choices
- Discuss potential improvements
- Be prepared for live coding

### Potential Questions
1. "Why did you choose Django over Flask?"
2. "How did you implement HOS compliance?"
3. "What would you add with more time?"
4. "How would you scale this application?"
5. "What challenges did you face?"

### Good Answers
1. Django provides robust ORM, admin interface, and REST framework
2. Implemented FMCSA 70hr/8day cycle with automatic rest break scheduling
3. User authentication, trip history, PDF export, real-time traffic
4. Add caching, database, load balancing, CDN for static files
5. Route API integration, ELD log generation, responsive design
