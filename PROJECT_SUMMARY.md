## Key Features

### 1. Route Calculation

- 70-hour/8-day cycle tracking
- 11-hour driving limit per day
- 14-hour on-duty limit per day
- 10-hour minimum rest breaks
- Automatic rest break scheduling

### 3. Trip Planning
- Calculates total distance and duration
- Schedules fuel stops (every 1000 miles)
- Allocates time for pickup/dropoff (1 hour each)
- Breaks trip into manageable segments
- Accounts for current cycle hours used

### 4. ELD Log Generation
- Generates visual daily log sheets
- Similar to traditional paper logs
- Shows 24-hour timeline with status lines
- Includes driving, on-duty, off-duty, and sleeper berth
- Downloadable as PNG images

### 5. User Interface
- Modern, responsive design

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/calculate-trip/
Calculates complete trip with route and ELD logs.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "current_location": "Los Angeles, CA",
  "pickup_location": "Phoenix, AZ",
  "dropoff_location": "Dallas, TX",
  "current_cycle_used": 25.5
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "route": {
    "current_location": {...},
    "pickup_location": {...},
    "dropoff_location": {...},
    "route_to_pickup": {...},
    "route_to_dropoff": {...},
    "total_distance_miles": 1234.5,
    "total_duration_hours": 22.5
  },
  "trip_plan": {
    "segments": [...],
    "daily_logs": [...],
    "num_rest_breaks": 2,
    "num_fuel_stops": 1
  },
  "log_sheets": ["base64_image1", "base64_image2"],
  "summary": {...}
}
```

### POST /api/geocode/
Converts address to coordinates.

### GET /api/health/
Health check endpoint.

## HOS Rules Implementation

### 70-Hour/8-Day Cycle
- Tracks cumulative hours over 8 days
- Prevents exceeding 70 hours total
- Calculates remaining available hours

### Daily Limits
- **Driving**: Maximum 11 hours per day
- **On-Duty**: Maximum 14 hours per day
- **Off-Duty**: Minimum 10 consecutive hours

### Automatic Scheduling
- Inserts rest breaks when limits reached
- Schedules fuel stops at appropriate intervals
- Allocates time for pickup/dropoff activities

## Design Decisions

### Why Django?
- Robust backend framework
- Built-in admin interface
- Excellent REST framework
- Easy deployment

### Why React?
- Component-based architecture
- Large ecosystem
- Great developer experience
- Easy to maintain

### Why Free APIs?
- No API key management for demo
- Unlimited testing during development
- Easy for reviewers to test
- Can upgrade to paid APIs later

### Why Leaflet over Google Maps?
- Free and open-source
- No API key required
- Lightweight
- Good documentation

## Calculations

### Distance & Time
- Average speed: 55 mph
- Driving time = Distance / Speed
- Total time includes rest, fuel, pickup/dropoff

### Rest Breaks
- Triggered when:
  - Driving hours ≥ 11
  - On-duty hours ≥ 14
- Duration: 10 hours minimum

### Fuel Stops
- Interval: Every 1000 miles
- Duration: 30 minutes each

### Pickup/Dropoff
- Duration: 1 hour each
- Counted as on-duty time

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing
- Multiple trip scenarios (short, medium, long)
- Different cycle hour values
- Various locations
- Error cases

### Browser Testing
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Desktop and mobile views
