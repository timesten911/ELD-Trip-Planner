# Loom Video Script (3-5 minutes)

## Introduction (30 seconds)

"Hi! I'm presenting my ELD Trip Planner application - a full-stack solution for truck drivers to plan trips with automatic Hours of Service compliance and ELD log generation.

This application is built with Django for the backend and React for the frontend, featuring a modern UI with TailwindCSS and real-time route visualization using OpenStreetMap."

## Application Demo (2 minutes)

### Show the Landing Page
"Here's the main interface. On the left, we have our trip input form, and on the right, we'll see our results once we calculate a trip.

Let me enter a sample trip:
- Current Location: Los Angeles, California
- Pickup Location: Phoenix, Arizona  
- Dropoff Location: Dallas, Texas
- Current Cycle Hours: Let's say I've already used 25 hours in my 8-day cycle

Now I'll click Calculate Trip..."

### Show Loading State
"The application is now:
1. Geocoding all three addresses to coordinates
2. Calculating the optimal truck route
3. Computing HOS compliance with rest breaks
4. Generating daily ELD log sheets

This takes about 5-10 seconds..."

### Map & Route Tab
"Great! Here are the results. We're on the Map & Route tab.

You can see:
- The blue marker is my current location in LA
- Green marker is the pickup in Phoenix
- Red marker is the dropoff in Dallas
- The route is drawn with polylines showing the complete path

The map automatically zooms to show all points. You can interact with it - zoom in, pan around, and click markers for details.

Below the map, we have quick stats: 1,400 miles, about 40 hours total duration, 3 rest breaks needed, and this will take 3 days."

### Trip Summary Tab
"Let me switch to the Trip Summary tab.

Here we see detailed statistics:
- Total distance and duration
- Number of rest breaks and fuel stops
- Days required
- Remaining cycle hours

Below that is the complete trip breakdown showing every segment:
- Pickup activity - 1 hour
- Driving segments with distances
- Fuel stops every 1000 miles
- Required rest breaks when we hit the 11-hour driving or 14-hour on-duty limits
- Dropoff activity

Each segment shows the time, duration, and distance. The color coding helps distinguish between driving (blue), rest (purple), and on-duty activities (green)."

### ELD Logs Tab
"Now the most important part - the ELD Logs tab.

This shows the actual daily log sheets that would be required for compliance. For this trip, we have 3 days of logs.

Each log shows:
- The date and daily statistics
- Driving hours: 11 hours
- On-duty hours: 14 hours  
- Off-duty hours: 10 hours
- Total miles driven that day

The visual log sheet below mimics the traditional paper logs with:
- A 24-hour timeline grid
- Four status lines: Off Duty, Sleeper, Driving, and On Duty
- Activities plotted across the timeline
- Remarks section for special activities

You can navigate between days using these arrows, and download any log sheet as a PNG image using this download button."

## Code Walkthrough (1.5 minutes)

### Backend
"Let me quickly show you the code structure.

On the backend, we have three main services:

1. **ELD Service** (show eld_service.py):
   - Implements all HOS rules: 70hr/8day cycle, 11hr driving limit, 14hr on-duty limit
   - Calculates trip segments with automatic rest break insertion
   - Generates daily logs from segments
   - All calculations are based on FMCSA regulations

2. **Routing Service** (show routing_service.py):
   - Geocodes addresses using Nominatim
   - Calculates routes using OSRM (free routing API)
   - Handles both current-to-pickup and pickup-to-dropoff routes
   - Returns coordinates and route geometry for map display

3. **Log Generator** (show log_generator.py):
   - Uses PIL (Pillow) to generate visual log sheets
   - Draws the 24-hour grid with status lines
   - Plots activities on the timeline
   - Returns base64-encoded PNG images

The API views (show views.py) tie everything together, handling requests and returning comprehensive trip data."

### Frontend
"On the frontend, we have clean React components:

1. **TripForm** (show TripForm.jsx):
   - Modern form with validation
   - Uses shadcn/ui components for consistent styling
   - Loading states and error handling

2. **RouteMap** (show RouteMap.jsx):
   - React-Leaflet integration
   - Custom markers with color coding
   - Polyline route visualization
   - Auto-fitting bounds

3. **TripSummary** (show TripSummary.jsx):
   - Statistics cards with icons
   - Scrollable segment list
   - Color-coded activities

4. **ELDLogViewer** (show ELDLogViewer.jsx):
   - Image display from base64
   - Navigation between days
   - Download functionality
   - Activity timeline

The main App component (show App.jsx) orchestrates everything with tabs for different views and handles API communication."

## Technical Highlights (30 seconds)

"Key technical features:
- RESTful API with Django REST Framework
- CORS configured for cross-origin requests
- Free APIs (no API keys needed for demo)
- Responsive design with TailwindCSS
- Modern UI components from shadcn/ui
- Comprehensive error handling
- Ready for deployment to Vercel and Railway

The application is fully documented with setup guides, deployment instructions, and testing procedures."

## Conclusion (30 seconds)

"This application demonstrates:
- Full-stack development with Django and React
- Complex business logic implementation for HOS compliance
- Third-party API integration
- Modern UI/UX design principles
- Production-ready code with proper structure

The app is live and ready for testing. All code is well-documented and follows best practices.

Thank you for watching! The complete source code and documentation are available in the repository."
